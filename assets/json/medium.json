Here, I would be sharing my experience doing an internship at Amazon, the selection process, and how I prepared for it.</em></p>\n<h4><strong>Preparation and Selection Tests</strong></h4>\n<p>I read previous test experiences from GFG, and knew that Amazon asks the standard questions in online assessment. Also, I practiced questions from Interview Bit and company-specific ones from GFG.</p>\n<h4><strong>Round 1: Online Assessment</strong></h4>\n<p>As expected, it was straightforward and consisted of the following sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Code Debug:</em> In this portion of the online assessment, which was given approximately <strong>20 minutes</strong>, it was asked to find bugs in seven snippets of code. STL was allowed.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Coding Test:</em> This portion of the online assessment consisted of a coding section<strong> </strong>which allowed Java, Python, C#, or C++ (my choice), and the time given was approximately <strong>70 minutes</strong>. Questions were elementary. I don’t remember the questions exactly, but all the questions were standard questions of elementary difficulty level, such as palindrome check, minimum difference between two numbers in an array, and so on.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Work Styles Assessment:</em> This was built around Amazon’s Leadership Principles and typically takes <strong>10–15 minutes</strong> to complete. In this section, you had to choose to what extent a provided statement represented your work style.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Logical Ability:</em> During this section, which was given about <strong>35 minutes, </strong>there were asked series of problem-solving multiple-choice questions. Speed of completion for each question was not a factor in the score.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Round 2: Face-to-Face Interview</strong></h4>\n<p>My Interview was scheduled for the next day, for which more than 20 students had been shortlisted.</p>\n<p>It started with a general tell me about yourself. While answering, I mentioned that I loved watching cricket. Luckily, the interviewer was also a fan of cricket, and as IPL was going on at that time, he asked me if I watched yesterday’s match, and then we discussed cricket and our favorite teams for the next 3–4 minutes. This discussion truly made me comfortable and helped me to <strong>keep calm</strong>.</p>\n<p>Then, I was asked to share my screen, and he shared a link with me where I have to write my code. He pasted the question on that doc and asked me to provide a solution.</p>\n<p>Then, I was asked to code a solution to <a href=\"https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/symmetric-binary-tree\"><strong>this</strong></a>. Pretty standard question; I started with a non-optimal approach and then discussed the optimal approach. Then he asked me to write the code for the discussed optimal approach, which I did, and followed up with some questions related to my code involving time and space complexities. He was satisfied with the answer.</p>\n<p>After this, I was asked a question similar to <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-zeroes-to-be-flipped-so-that-number-of-consecutive-1s-is-maximized\"><strong>this</strong></a>, which I hadn’t seen earlier. I discussed the approach and started writing code, asking for some hints along the way, which he provided. Upon finishing writing the code, he asked me to explain the same. I was not sure of my answer, and after some time of discussion, the time was up. There were no further rounds.</p>\n<p>The results came after 2–3 days. <strong>A total of 11 students had been selected</strong>. We received the offer letter in April, and the internship duration was to be eight weeks: from second week of May to first week of July.</p>\n<h4><strong>Internship</strong></h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kjXEK6GJsseMDQ2J7oMmJA.jpeg\"><figcaption>Goodies!</figcaption></figure><p>We received welcome goodies in January. Before the start of the Internship, we were given the option to choose between virtual and hybrid mode (which involved relocating to Bengaluru). But due to the second wave, the hybrid option was cancelled and everyone had to contend with a virtual intern.</p>\n<p>Before Day 1, I received a MacBook Pro and its accessories including a bag, and a headphone.</p>\n<p><strong>Week 1:</strong> We had the Day 1 Onboarding, and the Students Team helped us understand and get familiar with how things work at Amazon. During the orientations, they also introduced to us the core leadership principles that Amazon follows. After the orientation, My manager called me and I was introduced to my Mentor and onboarding buddy as well. Later in the week, I was assigned the project along with the resources necessary to learn the prerequisites.</p>\n<p><strong>Week 2–5</strong>: I started working on the project from week 2, my mentor helped me to break my project into sub-tasks and timeline, which helped me stay on track. The internal tools and support system inside Amazon were very amazing.</p>\n<p>There was a internal demo with the team after some initial implementation in week 4. I completed the initially decided goals, by the end of week 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Week 6–7:</strong> I was assigned some additional/stretch goals to be done in the next half of the internship, which I completed in these next 2 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Final Week:</strong> I completed the documentation, and did a final presentation to my team. The internship ended with a performance review from my manager and mentor.</p>\n<h4>About the Project</h4>\n<p>I got to know about my team and manager on Day 1. I was in the Amazon Aurora Storage team, which is a relational database service developed and offered by Amazon Web Services.</p>\n<p>At the beginning there were ten members in the team; which grew as few other interns joined the team. Here, you get to work on individual projects under the guidance of your mentor and team. My project was to monitor live CPU utilization of a system within MySQL engine, and when CPU utilization is at peak, throttle the less important processes like read ahead and batched read for scan queries, and instead give more CPU resources to more important process like Online Transactional Processing (OLTP). Dynamically changing the configuration parameters improves the OLTP performance when there are parallel queries going on, and it also improves the standalone scan query latency.</p>\n<p>We used to have daily standup meets at 10:30am, where everyone in the team updated about their work from yesterday and their plan for today. It was crucial to write clean code, get your code reviewed, and complete your project on time.</p>\n<h4><strong>Perks</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Flexible working hours.</li>\n<li>A MacBook Pro and all its accessories for work.</li>\n<li>Fifteen days accommodation in a 4 star hotel*</li>\n<li>You get a pickup &amp; drop cab from your location to office*</li>\n<li>You get flight tickets from your hometown to located city*</li>\n<li>At the beginning of every month, Rs 1100/- are credited to your zeta account, which you can use in the cafeteria*, or on Zomato and Swiggy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*if onsite Internship (sigh)</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MuoJ6KqBHJDw1OlHR8yFAA.jpeg\"><figcaption>Amazon Office, Hyderabad</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>General Tips</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you get your resume scrutinized by your seniors.</li>\n<li>While answering the coding question, <em>first explain the brute force approach, then try to optimize it</em>.

The internship started on 18th of May. The onboarding session was a day long session with various events planned for us. It started with the welcome note by our hiring manager and we were given a glimpse of the amazing work culture and ethics in the organization. We then had insightful sessions where various industry leaders sharing their journey and experiences with us. To end the day, we had a session with the technical team to get us started with the virtual desktops and access to various other stuff. The day was awesome and the BNYM management made sure we didn’t miss the luxury of being physically present there.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V6gPkjJOp2AvZbFUifoqMQ.jpeg\"></figure><h4><strong>Amazing folks</strong></h4>\n<p>I was the part of the Data Vault team in the Asset Servicing Technology division. The amazing people whom I met there will always have a special place in my heart. I along with my co-intern Anoop were the two summer interns in the team. I must say that we were fortunate to start with Kunal as our manager. He was a constant support to us and was the go-to person whenever we were stuck at any point of time or needed any help or guidance. Our buddies, Sakshi &amp; Harshita were very supportive to help us sail through the slightly painful task of initial environment setup and resolving our all silly doubts. My mentor Prem, was an <em>always available to help</em> person and got me through my initial stories to help me understand the project.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Project</strong></h4>\n<p>The <strong>Data Vault</strong> is an investment data platform by the BNYM Data Analytics &amp; Solutions team that enables our client to adopt to vault as their data strategy or upgrade their existing data strategies so as to make the best out of their data to make informed decisions. Our team was working on the vault pipeline which was responsible for the acquisition &amp; flexible warehousing of the data. Since the product we were working on was going to be generally available, we were given the stories that mainly revolved around the hardening of the platform for a seamless experience. Most of the tasks were backend and I primarily used Java &amp; Springboot as techstack. I also got exposure to DevOps tools such as Jenkins, Sonarqube and the concepts of microservice architecture and cloud based services.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Gpxa4UEVaxuAc_WGtup5Ww.jpeg\"><figcaption>Goodies!</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Explore, Learn, Grow</strong></h4>\n<p>There were ample opportunities in the organization to connect with and hear from the top leadership. We had a monthly Tech-EC connect session and I was honored to hear from Bhargavi Ma’am (Head of Asset Servicing Technology in BNYM) about her journey &amp; experiences. She guided as to how we should approach our internship and the corporate world in general as freshers. There were Executive Connect sessions at the global level for the complete batch of summer interns across all countries and we got a chance to connect with the global leadership of BNYM as well. BNYM also provides access to <strong>Pluralsight &amp; Saba</strong>, which had some amazing courses and really helped me to skill up as per the requirements of the project and financial industry.</p>\n<h4><strong>Fun Sessions</strong></h4>\n<p>Although, everything was completely virtual, the management ensured that we did not miss out on the fun part and made some memories to cherish upon. There were a couple of intern connect sessions during December &amp; March before the start of our internship so that we can get to know about our fellow interns. There were a few sessions in which we played games like dumb charades and scribble.</p>\n<h4><strong>Final Presentation</strong></h4>\n<p>At the last leg of our internship we had to present our work before the panel that comprised of people mainly from the top India leadership of the company. I was initially a bit nervous but the mock before my manager Anitha Jothi filled me with enormous confidence. The feedback she gave on my presentation and work were very satisfactory to me. The presentation before the panel also went very smooth and I was well able to cover all aspects of my internship. The comments from the panel were highly satisfying.</p>\n<p>After such a good experience in my internship, I was quite hoping for the PPO and those hopes turned into reality a week after the end of my internship with the mail from Office of CCD, IIT Guwahati. Congratulatory messages were pouring in from my friends, seniors &amp; juniors. It was such an amazing feeling.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would like to conclude with the fact that this summer has been an amazing experience for me😊. The transition from finding connected components in a graph to working on solving real world problems is the best part that the summer internship provides.</p>\n<p><em>A small learning I would like to share for people going to make their first corporate appearance the next year:</em></p>\n<p>Always have the bigger picture with you of whatever work you are doing and how it going to impact the lives of the target audience and the value your work adds to your organization.</p>\n<p><em>To people, especially my batchmates &amp; juniors who are yet to land into an internship/job offer:</em></p>\n<p>The whole process expects you to be patient and humble. You might be having failures coming your way initially but you need to hang around to play your perfect shot. Reach out to your friends if you feel low. Don’t forget to celebrate their success. Learn from your mistakes and keep improving. You are thankfully part of the system that provides you with ample number of opportunities. Always have that belief — You can &amp; You will😊</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7f87d93f0bd7\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace/interning-at-bny-mellon-prince-parag-shah-7f87d93f0bd7\">Interning at BNY Mellon | Prince Parag Shah</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace\">InPlace</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

There were a couple of intern connect sessions during December &amp; March before the start of our internship so that we can get to know about our fellow interns. There were a few sessions in which we played games like dumb charades and scribble.</p>\n<h4><strong>Final Presentation</strong></h4>\n<p>At the last leg of our internship we had to present our work before the panel that comprised of people mainly from the top India leadership of the company. I was initially a bit nervous but the mock before my manager Anitha Jothi filled me with enormous confidence. The feedback she gave on my presentation and work were very satisfactory to me. The presentation before the panel also went very smooth and I was well able to cover all aspects of my internship. The comments from the panel were highly satisfying.</p>\n<p>After such a good experience in my internship, I was quite hoping for the PPO and those hopes turned into reality a week after the end of my internship with the mail from Office of CCD, IIT Guwahati. Congratulatory messages were pouring in from my friends, seniors &amp; juniors. It was such an amazing feeling.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would like to conclude with the fact that this summer has been an amazing experience for me😊. The transition from finding connected components in a graph to working on solving real world problems is the best part that the summer internship provides.</p>\n<p><em>A small learning I would like to share for people going to make their first corporate appearance the next year:</em></p>\n<p>Always have the bigger picture with you of whatever work you are doing and how it going to impact the lives of the target audience and the value your work adds to your organization.</p>\n<p><em>To people, especially my batchmates &amp; juniors who are yet to land into an internship/job offer:</em></p>\n<p>The whole process expects you to be patient and humble. You might be having failures coming your way initially but you need to hang around to play your perfect shot. Reach out to your friends if you feel low. Don’t forget to celebrate their success. Learn from your mistakes and keep improving. You are thankfully part of the system that provides you with ample number of opportunities. Always have that belief — You can &amp; You will😊</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7f87d93f0bd7\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace/interning-at-bny-mellon-prince-parag-shah-7f87d93f0bd7\">Interning at BNY Mellon | Prince Parag Shah</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace\">InPlace</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

I was not interested in SDE based roles. I had not done DSA extensively and had no prior experience with WebD or AppD. Being a EEE department student, I started preparing for Digital Design based roles. But that wasn’t it. I was keen on Robotics and was a core team member of the Aeromodelling club for over a year. So here’s how it went.</p>\n<h4><strong>Preparation</strong></h4>\n<p>I didn’t target Data Science or Machine Learning roles at the beginning of my preparation. However, I had a good base in Linear algebra and Calculus that made ML a bit easy to start with. I started with the course everyone does- Machine Learning by Andrew Ng. I completed it and was keen on learning more, so I moved onto the Deep Learning specialization course. I was able to complete all five of them just before November. I read a lot of <strong>Towards Data Science</strong> articles and also learned a good bit of probability. OpenCV helped a lot in some Image Processing questions. I also did <strong>Analytics Vidhya’s</strong> topic-wise MCQs, and they were a great help in the tests. And that was it. I felt that my preparation was very little compared to my friends and was a bit worried about what might happen.</p>\n<h4><strong>Test &amp; Interview</strong></h4>\n<p>The test contained 4 sections: <strong>Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Aptitude and Data-based questions</strong>. Most of the questions were very similar and even identical to Analytics Vidhya’s blog. Computer Vision/ Image Processing needed quite a bit of experience, and others were easy. The Interview was the best part. The Interviewer was very friendly, and it felt more of a discussion than an interview. He asked me some questions about my project and some skills they valued. My project was based on a swarm of drones running a DL algorithm to find some objects. My main contribution was in Hardware, but I learnt a lot in DL from the seniors involved in the project. He posed some interesting questions on using the robotics knowledge I had to apply to the application they were experimenting with. He seemed very much convinced and said that we shall meet soon. This was my fourth interview, and I was so happy, thinking that I must be selected. However, when the results came, I had not made it! Distraught, I went on with my courses. Then things took another unexpected turn: I received a call from the HR asking if I was still available. I said yes, upon which I had a short HR round and got selected.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Intern</strong></h4>\n<p>The internship was a virtual one. I was assigned to a project where I learnt an <strong>Ultrasound Image Processing Algorithm</strong>. I can’t go into much more detail than that. The Interviewer was assigned as my mentor, and I had a great time. The work was little compared to others because it was a research internship. We were the ones exploring new possibilities on that front. I had a great time handling significant data points (each data point was around 3GB). It was a great experience for me. However, they did not offer any PPOs.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2dUrkzlCamjrOoKynKaQfg.jpeg\"></figure><h4><strong>Preparation tips</strong></h4>\n<p>As you would have noticed, my preparation was neither the best, nor the most comprehensive. I was lucky enough and had a good base in mathematics. But not everyone has. So I would suggest some things to learn. You need not be optimal, but should be good enough in these:</p>\n<p>1. Python (have a strong grip on it)</p>\n<p>2. Numpy + Matplotlib + Pandas (as essential as anything)</p>\n<p>3. Machine Learning by Andrew NG with python assignments.</p>\n<p>4. Kaggle’s Titanic challenge and learning EDA &amp; sklearn.</p>\n<p>5. Data Structures and Algorithms(at least till trees) and practice on InterviewBit.</p>\n<p>6. Deep learning Specialization by Andrew Ng.</p>\n<p>7. All topic-wise questions from Analytics Vidhya.</p>\n<p>This should be more than enough for most of the DS/ML companies. In particular for Philips, get some grip on Image Processing/Computer Vision. Learn OpenCV if you can.</p>\n<p>To conclude, <em>grab every chance that comes at you</em>. <em>Just find your interests, and you will do just fine. Don’t get disappointed if you are not selected.

First up were data structures in C++. Initially, I practiced around 2–3 hrs per day and eventually, upped it to 5–6 hours per day on an average. I didn’t do much of competitive programming, nor gave many contests; but would suggest doing the same if you want to scale up your time management skills. In addition, I also didn’t focus much on the other core concepts like OS and networking in the beginning, but by the time the tests began, was ready with these concepts too.</p>\n<h4><strong>Preparation tips</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn while you practice (or practice while you learn).</li>\n<li>Don’t compare yourselves with others, but do compare yourself with your yesterday self. This helps to keep a positive slope in your progress.</li>\n<li>Don’t get low if you didn’t make progress in the start. You can figure out eventually if you learn from your mistakes😉</li>\n<li>Make sure to have an environment where you don’t get disturbed (since it is your home, you can figure it out yourself).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Talk to your friends. </strong>They can not only help you with your problems (be it mental stress or anything else), but give you enough courage for you to face another.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Coding round</strong></h4>\n<p>I don’t remember the questions that were asked, but I do remember that to solve one of them, deque had to be used. The MCQs were from all the core concepts- pointers, OS, networking, etc.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Interview</strong></h4>\n<p>There were 2 rounds, the first one was technical and the second was supposed to be a managerial round (but was more like a tech &amp; managerial one for me).</p>\n<p><strong>First Round</strong></p>\n<p>The interviewer started with deep copying a linked list to create another linked list which looks exactly the same. Then he made it tougher by adding a feature to the linked list that the linked list is normal with one node pointing to another node, but at the same time one node can point to any random node in the given linked list and I should deep copy the given linked list. This discussion on deep-copying went on for 25 to 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>To be honest, he was not there for the answer but was testing <strong>my ability to analyse and my approach, and what are the consequences of each approach</strong> (things such as what would be the complexity, how efficient is it compared to the trivial one, what happens for the corner cases, what are the corner cases exactly here, etc.). And at the same time he was looking if I could use the hints and help he provided to go in the right direction.</p>\n<p>After this discussion ended, he was back to the fundamentals : pointers, core concepts, some facts about data structures etc. The pointers’ questions were a bit challenging because he was not just asking the question, but also trying to make me doubt my answer with other possible answers (be careful with pointers, they could hurt you if not handled well!). Only thing I can say is that, it’s not just coding what helps you crack interviews, but strong <strong>fundamentals </strong>are a must because the interviewer looks for intuition and reasoning behind something when you say that it would work.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Round</strong></p>\n<p>The second round commenced with a simple coding question (I don’t remember what that was but using hashmap did that thing), which I initially coded the long way. But he figured out that everything that I’d written is not needed, and asked me to do better (no hints this time :p), and then I did what he was expecting. Then I realised that this coding question was a warm-up for me and he jumped into discussions about me and introduced himself as well.</p>\n<p>After this introduction, he asked me a puzzle (simliar to the hourglass puzzle) and was impressed by my answer to that (it was a coincidence that I looked at it just before my first round). And then some little technical discussion about programming languages, concepts,etc.</p>\n<p>Moving on, I was asked the reason behind pursuing this field as I’m from ECE. I answered the same and coincidentally, he was from ECE too and could relate my reasons. After that, he gave me a real life situation: if one of my teammates isn’t agreeing with another, what could I do to resolve that and avoid it in the first place? Also he asked about my experience as a mentor for a project that my juniors did in the electronics club. Both rounds ended well.</p>\n<h4>The Internship</h4>\n<p>It was a great learning opportunity, and I was exposed to some of the best technologies in industry. I worked on APIs and automation, and had 2 mentors who helped me through everything. Also, my manager was very suuportive and was like a coach who helped me to learn a lot of professional things. I was treated no less than an employee and the work culture was very good.

I also wrote down all the possible questions that may be asked and what answer I will give to them. I read about the companies I was shortlisted in and wrote down their values too. I even discussed my resume on a video call with my friends.

It is necessary to have a good sleep before interviews as it is going to be a long day and a very long night. I had a very light dinner and kept some fruits along with me to eat if I get time. Stay hydrated and keep water beside you. I had three company interviews scheduled for the night — Google, Microsoft and Alphonso. Each company has around 2–4 interview rounds, most of them being elimination rounds, and time is of the essence here, so one needs to keep in mind to keep all the answers to the point so that you get sufficient time to solve the real coding questions.</p>\n<h4><strong>Some important words of wisdom</strong></h4>\n<p><em>Remember that placements should not be seen as competition, it can only be aced with collaborative efforts.</em></p>\n<p><em>The hard part is to deal with rejections in your targeted companies. But rejections are a part of life, keep your preparation at the level where a few rejections won’t matter to you.</em></p>\n<h4><strong>The Interviews</strong></h4>\n<p>First, I got a call for Microsoft interview at around 9 pm, and there were two rounds back to back. The first round started with a discussion around my resume, and the interviewer asked me to introduce myself and tell them about my projects. He asked a few related questions on the spot while I was describing my projects. I was able to answer them. And then, he moved to the coding part and gave me one challenging question, which I was supposed to solve on any IDE of my choice and send the codes to him at the end. I was able to solve the question. At the end of the interview, he asked me if I had any questions, and I got a call for the second round immediately after the first round ended. The second round format was almost similar, but in this round, I was asked 2 coding questions, which I found comparatively easier than the first round.</p>\n<p>After the second round ended, I got an interview call for Google at around 12 am, and there were about 4 rounds for me each of 45 mins, which went on till 3 am at night. In google, each interview starts with your introduction and what you have done, after which they share with you one google doc link on which the interviewer asks 2–3 coding questions in each round within those 45 minutes. One of the rounds also includes an HR round, where they check the googliness. Almost all of the questions asked were new to me and of good quality. I enjoyed solving them. One of the mistakes I made in this interview was that I picked up my phone in between the discussion. Keep your mobile phone away from you on silent while giving interviews, and pick it up only after each interview ends to take calls for the next round for online interviews.</p>\n<p>After this, at around 4:15 am, I was called for Alphonso’s interview. They started by asking me questions on operating system, which I could answer. After that, I was given two different codes, and I had to calculate their time complexities. I was able to answer, but I feel I gave the wrong answer to one of them. Then I was asked one system design question. I could list out the features needed, but I could not explain how to design classes so I was not called for further rounds in Alphonso.</p>\n<p>It was 5 am already, and the next slot was supposed to start at 7:30 am in the morning, so I decided to sleep, but I couldn’t sleep. Fortunately, I didn’t have to sit for the next slot. In the morning, the results came out and my happiness knew no bounds. I got placed at Microsoft. I was flooded with congratulations messages.</p>\n<p>At the end, I want to conclude by saying that there are enough companies out there to get you a good placement, and do not assume that any company is big enough to be out of your league.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*jM0JFlwTMLtJGM9GGhW_Kg.jpeg\"></figure><p><em>If the door is </em><strong><em>closed</em></strong><em>, doesn’t mean it’s</em><strong><em> locked</em></strong><em> and even </em><strong><em>if it is</em></strong><em>…</em><strong><em>You just might have the key!</em></strong></p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=45aa1d040419\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace/placement-experience-microsoft-pratham-arora-45aa1d040419\">Placement Experience | Microsoft | Pratham Arora</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace\">InPlace</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

Some of the typical digital design questions like making an AND, NAND gate from mux and such were asked, but if you have done your digital design course thoroughly then it would not be a major problem. Some pseudocode for Verilog functionality followed by discussion on some of the concept of Verilog also asked.</p>\n<p>Then we moved on to my projects. As I had several projects, most of them focusing on digital and embedded systems becoming a major chunk of my interview. The questions were along the lines of what sort of work I had done, the problems that I had faced and how they were tackled. Knowledge about the technology (protocol or the hardware used) was also tested and why I used some specific technology instead of competing ones (such as why you would use Arduino mega instead of uno).</p>\n<h3><strong>The Internship</strong></h3>\n<p>I was assigned to the NOC (Network in Chip) team of Tegra. It is the mobile division of NVIDIA and used for self-driving cars and Nintendo Switch. My team looked after several IPs and their NOC for the control signals. As these are to be developed for self-driving cars, safety is a big agenda on the list and most of the design focused on it. My assignment was to automate topology creation of 6 IPs that my team looked after. There was another mini task to automate generation of an interconnect chip-let which would act as the mesh through which control signals between masters and clients moved.</p>\n<p>To do the tasks I had to write scripts in Perl to generate files which would further be read by NVIDA’s internal tools to synthesise net-lists for various IPs. Learning Perl would have taken a lot of time, so I instead started to code right away using very simple logic and C-style language. This gave me ample of time to understand the problem and architecture of IPs instead of struggling with tools that I would be using.</p>\n<p>Majority of my time was spent asking my mentors, or at time whoever from my team was available to understand the structure of the design and reason for the way things were implemented. I mostly focused on my project and my mentors were helpful enough to set up and run NVIDA specific tools that might have taken me weeks to understand, set up and debug if they conflicted with my project. This had saved a lot of time for me as problems that I was facing were solved quickly. My mentor and other teammates (by the mid of my intern I was interacting and asking about stuff from most of my team instead of just my mentor) were very helpful and always encouraged me to ask more questions. Although asking around is a good idea but over doing it might annoy people, so I stuck with a simple rule to spend 60 mins on the problem first, try to solve it by myself, get an idea about what might be wrong and how I can solve it. This would help to develop some insight about the problem and when you discuss it with others you would get a better understanding about the fix. The projects were very crucial to the flow of my team and the work that I did was being used extensively after I had completed it. When I joined, I had not hoped that my project would still be alive but to my surprise it was still being developed and updated by my teammates. The tasks that they give is not just a dummy task but something that they are still using.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wMD_q072IGQuF34fubYmRA.jpeg\"></figure><h3>Work Culture</h3>\n<p>The work culture in NVIDIA is awesome. There is infinite work from home policy, though exploiting it should not be considered. As the company follows a horizontal hierarchy and even your teammates encourage you not to use tiles like Sir/Ma’am. There is nobody who monitor you and keep a track of where you are. They will ask for updates, but the task is your responsibility alone and you are free to do it however you want. If something that you do does not break the existing structure and model then nobody will dictate you to do your work in certain manner, you have the freedom to do it your way. The work hours are quite flexible and there were sometimes when I woke up late and came in as late as lunch time. At the same time, NVIDA does not has a culture of staying till late working, with most of the people leaving the office by 5PM. The company follows the philosophy of <strong>‘speed of light’</strong>. It encourages people to complete the task at hand as fast as possible and keep moving ahead. It might not be evident by me just saying it but you can find various instances where the philosophy is applied.</p>\n<p>The internship was free from stress and my team made sure to accommodate me as much as they could. For the rest of stuff, NVIDIA makes sure that you do not have to run around the city to settle in. They provided accommodation for the entirety of internship. Breakfast was provided at the hotel itself and lunch at the office. Also travel from hotel to my office was arranged by the company. This meant that I was saving most the money that I was being paid and had extra room to spend on stuff that I wanted. These facilities are provided to every employee in the company.</p>\n<p>To summarise, the work culture allows flexibility and allows you to tackle the problem the way you want. The stuff you would be working on will be used somehow by the team and not scrapped as soon as you finish your intern. Due to the horizontal hierarchy of the company your opinion is listened and considered if what you say makes sense. The company’s<strong> ‘speed of light’ </strong>encourages to keep you moving ahead, and they help you to do so by not having you worried about where you stay, or where you will have your breakfast.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5e3333084acc\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace/interning-at-nvidia-eshant-verma-5e3333084acc\">Interning at NVIDIA | Eshant Verma</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace\">InPlace</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

She is currently interning with BlockDeliver, a New York based startup. As a recipient of the Google WTM scholarship and D.E Shaw’s DESIS Ascend fellowship, she also shares key points for future applicants to these programs.</em></p>\n<h4>Part I: Freshman year and branch change!</h4>\n<p>To be honest, I had never thought about getting a branch change when I joined IITG. I was just keen on getting a good CPI so that, if/when my grades fall in the later semesters, the balance is maintained. (Lol, we all have heard first year is the easiest one to get a good CPI!) I liked the sem I syllabus and enjoyed studying it. I was involved in a few extracurricular activities too. I was also a part of Cepstrum as Dhansiri’s Hostel Representative. Before the results of sem I were announced, I was expecting a 9.2 something. But my surprise went through the roof on seeing 9.81! I was just as shocked as my friends. And then my parents and friends began to encourage me to study well in the next sem too and get a branch change. Sem II didn’t go as smoothly, but I landed up with an overall CPI of 9.56.</p>\n<p>My main reason behind opting for Computer Science was my fear of Electronics. Circuits have haunted me since school days. Signals and transistors are one of the scariest nightmares for me. Had I not received a CPI enough for branch change, I would have probably made peace with transistors, signals, circuits and all other members of the ECE family. But since I had the option to change my stream, I was more than willing to befriend algorithms, databases, operating systems and much more!</p>\n<p>For branch change aspirants, a few tips would be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be regular in studies. That being said, it doesn’t mean you have to study everyday for long hours. C’mon JEE is over guys! By regular I mean ensure that when you enter the class, you have a sound idea of what’s going on. Don’t postpone studying so much that the lectures seem like Latin to you.</li>\n<li>Solve tutorials. I can’t stress the importance of this tip enough. Tutorial questions mostly cover all important concepts taught in the class. They are a reflection of the kind of questions you will get in exams (sometimes even the same questions appear). Revise them well the night before the exam too.</li>\n<li>Be easy on yourself. Don’t obsess over branch change. Maintain a balance between studying and extracurricular activities, too much of either is harmful.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Part II: Sophomore year — Fascination with Blockchain</h4>\n<p>Sophomore year is when you truly enter your department. You are free to experiment with various domains and find out what interests you the most. I, along with two of my friends, participated in Microsoft’s Code.Fun.Do Hackathon 2019. Its theme was ‘<strong>E-Voting using Blockchain</strong>’. That’s where I was first introduced to Blockchain. Such hackathons are really beneficial and play a valuable role in helping you hunt for your interests. Later in December, I pursued Blockchain by doing various projects. Soon I got many research opportunities in Blockchain.</p>\n<p>During my intern at BlockDeliver, I got a chance to work on Algorithms and Networks along with Blockchain. I was exposed to Hardware Security as a part of a project I am chosen for, under the guidance of one of the most amazing professors of the CSE department, Dr. Jose. Currently I have experience in a handsome number of CSE fields, and the best way to get that is through projects, interns and courses. I am still not a hundred percent sure of the domain I want to finally choose. BTech is like a bird’s eye view of the possible fields one can enter. And I am still exploring, with Deep Learning added to my radar recently, while continuing to work on all the previously mentioned areas. I enjoy having first-hand experience at so many things. It’s wondrous how vast the world of computer science is. And I want to roam a lot in that world, before I decide to settle down in one place and call it my home!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/951/1*zxqFAJcshia-Fs3-Q3j34Q.jpeg\"></figure><h4>Part III: Research paper — ideation to publication</h4>\n<p>Writing a research paper is truly an art. I learnt from my guide and co-author Dr. Kalyani how a research paper should be. In addition to being technically sound, it should have a logical flow, accompanied by smooth transitions between sections. It should unfold like a story. I hope I will be able to incorporate all these qualities in my future papers as well.</p>\n<p>I had a pretty systematic procedure that I followed for writing the paper. First I chose the broad domain ‘Blockchain and Smart Grids’. Then I spent two weeks exploring the subdomains and reviewing what all previous works had been done. I finalized the topic ‘A Blockchain-based Smart Grid Model for Rural Electrification in India’, mainly because I wanted to study how the new technologies can facilitate the life of the rural community. Having a humanitarian approach is one of the qualities my family has imbibed in me since childhood. Choosing a good research topic with a lot of potential is the basis of an influential research. It’s the base of your paper, hence I preferred to spend enough time at this first crucial step.</p>\n<p>Next, I conducted a brief literature review on the topic I had chosen, and soon realized that this topic hadn’t been touched to a great extent. In the first part of the paper, it’s important to describe the severity of the chosen problem. I stressed on that enough by going through various government reports on rural electrification and the truth of 100% electrification. Once I had formed a background, I introduced Blockchain (Blockchain is a peer-to-peer technology, a digital ledger to record information in a way that makes it impossible to hack, or cheat the system.)</p>\n<p>Further I went on to study how Blockchain can improve Smart Grids in various ways and explained each of them in detail. I could combine all the applications in a single model that can serve the rural population and provide them reliable and sufficient access to electricity. Testing and experimentation with the proposed model is yet a work in progress.</p>\n<p>This step-wise approach helped me a lot in the process of writing the paper. Further, this paper received acceptance at the peer-reviewed international conference <strong>IEEE’s icSmartGrid2020</strong> and I had the opportunity of presenting it there.</p>\n<h4>Part IV: Paper presentation at IEEE’s icSmartGrid2020 conference</h4>\n<p>After the completion of the paper, the next task was to get it published. I wanted to publish my paper in a peer-reviewed conference as it is more valued in the research community. Many conferences had sent out their Call for Papers. I submitted my paper at IEEE’s icSmartGrid2020 during mid-May, and just a few weeks later I was notified about the acceptance of the paper, along with reviews from 3 reviewers with positive feedback on some sections and suggestions on few points that could be improved. After making the necessary changes, the final paper was accepted to get published on IEEEXplore after the conference.</p>\n<p>Presenting at IEEE’s icSmartGrid2020 is one of the most memorable experiences of my life. I witnessed many presentations of mind-blowing research papers by researchers from the entire world. I think I was the youngest presenter there, and it was quite daunting at first, with so many scholars, experienced researchers and academicians present. But as I progressed with the presentation, I became more confident and it went very well. I could clarify all the various doubts raised by the audience after the session. Receiving the certificate and appreciation by the session chairs was a moment of absolute joy for me. I had always dreamed of having my first research paper in the second year itself, but had never imagined this could come true! From starting to write the paper, to getting acceptance at an international conference, to presenting it on a global platform; every moment is etched into my brain. I hope to have many more such experiences.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*I6_jYJ91pJeDlk7N\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wT-LWUuN4yu0THpc\"></figure><h4>Part V: BlockDeliver intern experience</h4>\n<p>I am currently working as a research intern at BlockDeliver, for more than 4 months now (received an extension offer after the decided intern duration). It’s a New York-based startup involved in the creation of a global ecosystem for web content delivery, powered by AI and Blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>Through this internship, I have learnt a lot about how technical research is carried out in the industry. I have realized subtle differences between academic and industrial research. In the industry, it’s important to have solutions deployable on a mega scale. It is expected that you come up with solutions within the set deadlines. Whereas academic research is freer and the solutions are tested out on smaller test setups, their results might be drastically different when deployed on a larger scale. Academic research works in the direction of developing theory. It can guide industrial research. Both are equally enjoyable for me; I find research very soothing. Being a researcher, you get absolute freedom to think and create newer systems and solutions, and truly witness the power of every domain.</p>\n<p>Jack Ma says “When you are 20 to 30 years old, you should follow a good boss and join a good company to learn how to do things properly”.

And my resume showed that I had projects, a research paper, an intern in the same field. If I had answered Machine Learning, it wouldn’t have been supported by my resume. Moral: Be genuine.</li>\n<li>Essay answers should be to the point. For example, in the above question, don’t write few lines each on many technologies. That’s an unclear and imprecise answer. Choose one and stick to it.</li>\n<li>It’s better to have essay answers customized, i.e. include your own life experiences and make it personal.</li>\n<li>Be authentic. Don’t fake stuff in your resume as you won’t be able to defend it later. The interviews are fun and they are just to get to know you more. Just be yourself.</li>\n<li>Community engagement is valued a lot.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’d like to end this blog by saying, BTech is a window into all the career paths one can pursue.

I was just keen on getting a good CPI so that, if/when my grades fall in the later semesters, the balance is maintained. (Lol, we all have heard first year is the easiest one to get a good CPI!) I liked the sem I syllabus and enjoyed studying it. I was involved in a few extracurricular activities too. I was also a part of Cepstrum as Dhansiri’s Hostel Representative. Before the results of sem I were announced, I was expecting a 9.2 something. But my surprise went through the roof on seeing 9.81! I was just as shocked as my friends. And then my parents and friends began to encourage me to study well in the next sem too and get a branch change. Sem II didn’t go as smoothly, but I landed up with an overall CPI of 9.56.</p>\n<p>My main reason behind opting for Computer Science was my fear of Electronics. Circuits have haunted me since school days. Signals and transistors are one of the scariest nightmares for me.

He is currently working as an Associate Data Scientist at NoBroker.com.</em></p>\n<p>Hello everyone, I am Apoorva Kumar, and I recently graduated from the EEE Department of IIT Guwahati. I am currently employed as an Associate Data Scientist at NoBroker.com. While my placement journey may sound unconventional, it surely was a memorable one and will help anyone pursuing the data science profile immensely. I will start with my 3rd year intern followed by why I chose Data Science and what other plans I had, to how I ended up being placed here. Please bear with me 😅.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Intern which changed my perspective</strong></h4>\n<p>So I landed a very lucrative internship at a Semiconductor firm in South Korea named <strong>Protec Inc.</strong> who are one of the lead suppliers for Samsung. I joined a small team which worked on using Machine Learning and Robotics to automate chip designing. My main project was to design a Stereo Camera based Odometry ( a technique to track the path of a moving object ) for a self driving vehicle. It was an interesting blend of Robotic and Machine Learning to build something new and interesting. We started by building a depth image from stereo camera using computer vision techniques to capture features which will be used for understanding how the robot is moving. We implemented multiple techniques to perform the depth sensing task and chose the technique which was best suited for our scenario. Next we performed odometry using novel features extraction technique in ROS from the depth image and concluded their output for use in production.</p>\n<p>The work, both in Robotics and Deep Learning, was wondrous and the state-of-the-art implementation for real world scenarios really gave me a kick and further solidified my interest in the field of ML based automation, Robotics and Data Science.</p>\n<h4><strong>What is Data Science?</strong></h4>\n<p>I will start by saying that <strong>Data Science or DS </strong>is essentially not a very defined field. Like Software Dev have Java and C++ Devs separately, Data Scientist profiles also range from <em>Data Analyst</em> to <em>ML/DL Engineers</em>. I was more interested in the latter. I would like to bring to notice here the very important aspect of reading the job profile completely and looking if it really fits you rather than just applying based on by the name of the profile. “<em>Don’t judge a book by its cover”</em> seems utterly viable here.</p>\n<p>These roles capture work ranging from basic data management and analysis to applying state-of-the-art techniques to empower real-world products used by millions of users. Sounds pretty heavy right? Well to be honest the fun really overtakes all the anxiety and effort that goes into making and developing such techniques. Anyone who has a knack for learning new things and automating the world around them should try for these profiles.</p>\n<h4><strong>Why DS or more appropriately How DS?</strong></h4>\n<p>I will start by saying that Machine Learning and Robotics has always been my passion since I joined college and I have stuck to that with everything I had. After completing my internship in the same two fields I was more than confident about my profile. I had a clear plan that I would only apply for Machine Learning(ML/DL) profiles ( Robotics profiles sadly don’t visit campus) and won’t sway from it under any circumstances. Data Science as I mentioned above is the broader field under which ML/DL lies, and thus began my journey towards being a Data Scientist.</p>\n<h4><strong>Before the Interview: The Learning and The Tests</strong></h4>\n<p>Once I had my eyes set on Data Science profiles all my efforts went in that direction. I only applied for Data Science roles and skipped all Software Developer and other roles. I actually ended up applying for only 21 profiles compared to others who had applied for more than 50 profiles and to be honest this fact had me on my toes till the point that I was placed.</p>\n<p>Starting with your resume — it will turn out to be either your best friend or your worst enemy during your interviews. While it might not seem very relevant during the test phase, the resume will play a major role as a point of discussion and forming the first impression of you on your interviewer. Try to make a one-page CV with good work experience and only your top 3 or 4 projects. Keep your description precise and highlight the keywords.

Topics related to Basic Machine Learning, probability and linear algebra were most important with added concepts of Deep Learning if you have time.

I did all my preparation using these slides and cleared my doubts by just searching the question on Internet or asking friends. I also focused on mastering Python libraries as it’s the preferred language for Data Science profiles.</p>\n<p>Coding, including but not limited to, Data-Structures and Algorithms was also a requirement as some companies used to put coding questions in DS profile tests.

He is currently working as an Associate Data Scientist at NoBroker.com.</em></p>\n<p>Hello everyone, I am Apoorva Kumar, and I recently graduated from the EEE Department of IIT Guwahati. I am currently employed as an Associate Data Scientist at NoBroker.com. While my placement journey may sound unconventional, it surely was a memorable one and will help anyone pursuing the data science profile immensely. I will start with my 3rd year intern followed by why I chose Data Science and what other plans I had, to how I ended up being placed here. Please bear with me 😅.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Intern which changed my perspective</strong></h4>\n<p>So I landed a very lucrative internship at a Semiconductor firm in South Korea named <strong>Protec Inc.</strong> who are one of the lead suppliers for Samsung. I joined a small team which worked on using Machine Learning and Robotics to automate chip designing. My main project was to design a Stereo Camera based Odometry ( a technique to track the path of a moving object ) for a self driving vehicle. It was an interesting blend of Robotic and Machine Learning to build something new and interesting. We started by building a depth image from stereo camera using computer vision techniques to capture features which will be used for understanding how the robot is moving. We implemented multiple techniques to perform the depth sensing task and chose the technique which was best suited for our scenario. Next we performed odometry using novel features extraction technique in ROS from the depth image and concluded their output for use in production.</p>\n<p>The work, both in Robotics and Deep Learning, was wondrous and the state-of-the-art implementation for real world scenarios really gave me a kick and further solidified my interest in the field of ML based automation, Robotics and Data Science.</p>\n<h4><strong>What is Data Science?</strong></h4>\n<p>I will start by saying that <strong>Data Science or DS </strong>is essentially not a very defined field. Like Software Dev have Java and C++ Devs separately, Data Scientist profiles also range from <em>Data Analyst</em> to <em>ML/DL Engineers</em>. I was more interested in the latter. I would like to bring to notice here the very important aspect of reading the job profile completely and looking if it really fits you rather than just applying based on by the name of the profile. “<em>Don’t judge a book by its cover”</em> seems utterly viable here.</p>\n<p>These roles capture work ranging from basic data management and analysis to applying state-of-the-art techniques to empower real-world products used by millions of users. Sounds pretty heavy right? Well to be honest the fun really overtakes all the anxiety and effort that goes into making and developing such techniques. Anyone who has a knack for learning new things and automating the world around them should try for these profiles.</p>\n<h4><strong>Why DS or more appropriately How DS?</strong></h4>\n<p>I will start by saying that Machine Learning and Robotics has always been my passion since I joined college and I have stuck to that with everything I had. After completing my internship in the same two fields I was more than confident about my profile. I had a clear plan that I would only apply for Machine Learning(ML/DL) profiles ( Robotics profiles sadly don’t visit campus) and won’t sway from it under any circumstances. Data Science as I mentioned above is the broader field under which ML/DL lies, and thus began my journey towards being a Data Scientist.</p>\n<h4><strong>Before the Interview: The Learning and The Tests</strong></h4>\n<p>Once I had my eyes set on Data Science profiles all my efforts went in that direction. I only applied for Data Science roles and skipped all Software Developer and other roles. I actually ended up applying for only 21 profiles compared to others who had applied for more than 50 profiles and to be honest this fact had me on my toes till the point that I was placed.</p>\n<p>Starting with your resume — it will turn out to be either your best friend or your worst enemy during your interviews. While it might not seem very relevant during the test phase, the resume will play a major role as a point of discussion and forming the first impression of you on your interviewer. Try to make a one-page CV with good work experience and only your top 3 or 4 projects. Keep your description precise and highlight the keywords. Don’t try to squish in things just because you did it but see if they are really relevant to the job you want.</p>\n<p>Moving on to what I studied. Topics related to Basic Machine Learning, probability and linear algebra were most important with added concepts of Deep Learning if you have time. I had these two beautiful courses named <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=12u4yr6PcezfHqHdXAq3g2_eTG1blCrkt\">Fundamentals of AI</a> and <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1Q13XloxmTl-UAiUwB5xQbWnwQ9MICw3A\">Advanced Probability &amp; Random Processes</a> which helped me revise all these topics over the course of my 7th Semester.

I recently graduated from EEE dept, IIT Guwahati and am currently working as a Data &amp; Applied Scientist at Microsoft. While documenting my placement experience, I realized that my story may not fit in the standard experience catalogue of people. I had varying priorities regarding placements &amp; higher education, and the latter usually remained on the top all the time. Nevertheless, this article includes my personal story and lessons I learned throughout the placement season, which would be helpful for students applying for data science profiles in the upcoming placement season.</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Why Data Science</strong>:</h4>\n<p>Coming to my experience with the placement process, starting with a clear view of the profiles to apply for is critical. The first question that needs answering is: Why pursue Data Science? And what do these roles fulfil? I personally think anyone having a knack for innovating &amp; engineering products using data through recent advances in machine learning should definitely try. In short, data scientists are the middlemen that bring in state-of-the-art research and engineers it for the product improvisation. Moreover, for students interested in the research aspects of ML, these positions require keeping up with the state-of-the-art techniques and collaborating with research scientists, thus keeping up one’s exposure into the domain &amp; assisting in higher studies.</p>\n<h4><strong>Pre-Test preparations:</strong></h4>\n<p>When I started out, I was clear on which companies I would be targeting, and I directed my preparations accordingly. With my decision to go forward with both higher education &amp; placement preparations, I went ahead only with companies having Data Science job profiles &amp; targeted some individual companies working in ML even though the job position doesn’t explicitly mention Data Science. Before the tests, I majorly focused on revising &amp; revisiting machine learning concepts (especially its application aspects), probability &amp; linear algebra, solving puzzles and reviewing ML libraries in Python. Moreover, I also practised some coding problems covering the basics of data structures &amp; algorithms from InterviewBit &amp; GeeksForGeeks. I wasn’t able to devote a lot of time towards coding. Still, it is always better to practice more coding, as there are companies with Data Science profiles that conduct coding tests only. While my preparation in ML was based on 2+ years of experience in the same; it may not be the case for everyone. So, in the points below, I will go over some ‘before test preparation’ tips briefly.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Resume: <br>It is a critical part of the placement process. Some go-to tips I followed: Start your resume early on and always try keeping it concise, brief and explanatory; in one-page if possible. Describe your internships and projects such that even a layman can grasp the idea with little understanding of the topic. Avoid using complex terms, code names, etc unless it’s absolutely necessary. If one has multiple projects, only include those on which you can emphasize and show your contribution.</li>\n<li>Portfolio: <br>For Data Science profiles, projects and internships in ML related domains matter a lot. Having great (personal &amp; internship) projects, open-source contributions in famous ML libraries or packages, excellent Kaggle profile, and research papers will definitely help stand out of the crowd.</li>\n<li>Machine Learning: <br>One would need a thorough understanding of machine learning algorithms, their theoretical<strong> </strong>aspects and applications. Along with it, basic knowledge of deep learning would also be a good addition. I used this <a href=\"http://index-of.es/Varios-2/Hands%20on%20Machine%20Learning%20with%20Scikit%20Learn%20and%20Tensorflow.pdf\"><strong>book</strong></a> as my go-to reference for ML concepts and applications. Apart from this, some companies ask coding problems on simple ML models based on regression and time-series data. For those, one should also require familiarity with machine learning libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><strong>Test:</strong></h4>\n<p>For Microsoft’s Data Scientist role, the test was MCQ based, consisting of around 60+ MCQs in 60 minutes. The test covered theoretical &amp; application aspects of several topics in machine learning, such as regression, classification, decision trees, random forests, SVM, neural networks, generative/discriminative models and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Furthermore, it included some questions based on skip connections and language models, thus requiring a brief idea of essential concepts in deep learning. While the Microsoft test was solely MCQ based, some other tests actually needed us to code up solutions for ML problems in a short time frame. I also encountered questions on SQL and R language, but they are occasional and can be anticipated beforehand through the job description. For test preparation, I have shared a brief list of topics at the end of this article that covers up a vast majority of test &amp; interview topics.</p>\n<p>Two days before the interviews, around 11 students were shortlisted for the interview process. For the SDE profile, Microsoft has a standard ‘Group Fly’ round a day before the interviews, where they give coding questions to solve and select a handful of students for the interviews. While in my case, we were informed that the ‘group fly’ round was not meant for Data Scientist profiles, and we moved forward to the interview process directly. 12 hours before the interviews, I revisited all my notes on ML algorithms, reviewed my resume and focused primarily on previous interview questions and case studies. Apart from that, I relaxed, chilled out and ate a lot of chocolates. :P</p>\n<h4><strong>Interview:</strong></h4>\n<p>Coming to the interviews, the process had 3 rounds, all technical interviews and no HR round. In the first round, the interviewer asked me to choose any machine learning algorithm I liked and inquired more on its theoretical aspects. For some specific questions, he was expecting answers understandable to a layman. Below are some of the questions that were asked:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How would you explain information gain in decision trees?</li>\n<li>How would you design an anomaly detection algorithm using variants of decision trees?</li>\n<li>Neural Networks &amp; weight matrices, backpropagation</li>\n<li>Questions related to Ensemble models and stacking.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second round was more of a case study. Firstly the interviewer asked me if I have worked on any projects that involve feature engineering. Then, he presented a problem, where one is expected to build a classification system that detects faults or bone cracks in high-resolution X-ray images while optimizing several other factors like time delay, cloud processing, scalability, need for local compute etc. With each idea I propose, he corrected and directed me towards a different aspect. The round went on for about 30 minutes or more on the same question. Though my final answer was not what he had expected, he was happy that I reached pretty close and kept churning out viable solutions.</p>\n<p>In the third round, the interviewer focused more on my projects &amp; internships. The interviewer was observant &amp; inquisitive towards my internships. As most of my projects involved reinforcement learning, he asked me about some mathematical formulations regarding the same. Moreover, he was curious about the motivation behind those projects. Finally, he started asking questions on ML algorithms &amp; data pipelines, each more difficult than the last till I wasn’t able to answer. The final question where the interview ended was:</p>\n<p>‘How would you design a clustering algorithm using decision trees?’</p>\n<p>Overall, all the interviewers were extremely friendly, polite and always entertained questions from my side. What I feel helped me a lot during the interview, apart from the core ML knowledge is my past experience on multiple related projects &amp; internships. Revisiting those learning pathways during interviews adds practicality &amp; strong support for the solution I propose. Apart from all that, keep your interview priorities straight and clear, be attentive &amp; confident, and last but not least, be curious and learn from every experience.</p>\n<p>There is no foolproof way to crack data science interviews, but it is with one’s own experience and of others before that can help navigate the unknown. Enjoy the placements, learn from it, help your friends and don’t forget to smile throughout the process. May the force be with you!</p>\n<h4>List of ML topics to review:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Naive Bayes (Decision boundary)</li>\n<li>Linear &amp; Logistic Regression</li>\n<li>Multi-class vs Multi-Label Classification</li>\n<li>SVM</li>\n<li>Decision Trees</li>\n<li>Random Forests</li>\n<li>Bias Variance Trade-Offs</li>\n<li>Time-Series Data Handling</li>\n<li>k-Means Clustering</li>\n<li>PCA, LDA, t-Sne</li>\n<li>L[1-inf] losses and their behaviours</li>\n<li>Metrics (Precision, Recall, ROC AUC, F1 Score, PR AUC)</li>\n<li>Regularization</li>\n<li>Backpropagation</li>\n<li>Ensemble Models</li>\n<li>Skip connections</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=130df038890\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace/placement-experience-microsoft-data-science-varshil-gandhi-130df038890\">Placement Experience | Microsoft Data Science | Varshil Gandhi</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace\">InPlace</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

The interviewer was observant &amp; inquisitive towards my internships. As most of my projects involved reinforcement learning, he asked me about some mathematical formulations regarding the same. Moreover, he was curious about the motivation behind those projects. Finally, he started asking questions on ML algorithms &amp; data pipelines, each more difficult than the last till I wasn’t able to answer. The final question where the interview ended was:</p>\n<p>‘How would you design a clustering algorithm using decision trees?’</p>\n<p>Overall, all the interviewers were extremely friendly, polite and always entertained questions from my side. What I feel helped me a lot during the interview, apart from the core ML knowledge is my past experience on multiple related projects &amp; internships. Revisiting those learning pathways during interviews adds practicality &amp; strong support for the solution I propose. Apart from all that, keep your interview priorities straight and clear, be attentive &amp; confident, and last but not least, be curious and learn from every experience.</p>\n<p>There is no foolproof way to crack data science interviews, but it is with one’s own experience and of others before that can help navigate the unknown. Enjoy the placements, learn from it, help your friends and don’t forget to smile throughout the process. May the force be with you!</p>\n<h4>List of ML topics to review:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Naive Bayes (Decision boundary)</li>\n<li>Linear &amp; Logistic Regression</li>\n<li>Multi-class vs Multi-Label Classification</li>\n<li>SVM</li>\n<li>Decision Trees</li>\n<li>Random Forests</li>\n<li>Bias Variance Trade-Offs</li>\n<li>Time-Series Data Handling</li>\n<li>k-Means Clustering</li>\n<li>PCA, LDA, t-Sne</li>\n<li>L[1-inf] losses and their behaviours</li>\n<li>Metrics (Precision, Recall, ROC AUC, F1 Score, PR AUC)</li>\n<li>Regularization</li>\n<li>Backpropagation</li>\n<li>Ensemble Models</li>\n<li>Skip connections</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=130df038890\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace/placement-experience-microsoft-data-science-varshil-gandhi-130df038890\">Placement Experience | Microsoft Data Science | Varshil Gandhi</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/inplace\">InPlace</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

In this article, I will be writing about my 3rd-year internship experience and what I’ve learnt from it.</p>\n<p>Let me start from the beginning of my 3rd year, which is probably the first time you make a resume, start thinking about how to answer questions like “Introduce yourselves” in an interview, and surf through various competitive coding assessment platforms like Geeksforgeeks, InterviewBit etc. Just like everybody else, I had also started coding in the summer of 2019. Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming etc. Apart from mainstream coding, I also was into full-stack development and learnt a bunch of backend technologies like Django, Node.js. I had my troubles with the whole front-end development and the design. I was fairly comfortable with handling databases and APIs.</p>\n<p>So with such a profile, I tried to get an SDE internship during the campus internship process. And fast forward two months after the internship session began, I was shortlisted for only one company which was offering an internship in a cloud computing role. I made it only till the interview round. That gave me a good confidence boost, but it seriously made me rethink where my interests lie. I tried to look back on different kinds of activities I was part of and the PORs I held on campus.</p>\n<p>It took me some time to realise that I have a genuine fascination with the idea of a product or service, and everything that happens around it — starting from the concept of the product, designing it, finding its desirability, discovering customers, finding the product’s market fit, developing the product, to launching the product and then reiterating the entire circle from the feedback you get! I realised that product or software development was just a part of the bigger picture and that’s what I’m interested in. I started going through various online resources and doing product management courses on Coursera to get a basic idea. And so, I started looking for product management interns off-campus. And luckily I got an opportunity for a 4-month product internship at Mithi Software Technologies, through a friend’s referral.</p>\n<p>So, my work during the internship was to identify various use-cases and make automated workflow integrations between their already existing app, Ideolve, which is a note-based team collaboration platform (similar to slack, Trello), and other applications, using Zapier. My first task was to make a workflow between Ideolve and Gmail. Whenever the user gets a new mail on Gmail, it automatically triggers the creation of a new note with the contents of the mail on Ideolve. The working of this would pretty much remove the purpose of having to open Gmail every time and keep having the mails show up on Ideolve. Zapier is a platform that enables such automated workflows between applications. So using Zapier, I was supposed to make many such workflows.</p>\n<p>The technical side of my work included analysing the developments needed for the Ideolve API to be able to perform the workflows and query the data without any alteration. This required me to be in constant touch with my mentor and discuss the new changes needed within the Ideolve application and its API.</p>\n<p>The non-technical side of my work involved assessing the desirability and viability of these workflows, which demands a lot of research and most importantly requires one to think from the position of an end-user.</p>\n<p>There were multiple online meetings and demos with the CTO and my mentor, and with each session, I was asked to fine-tune the workflows for efficient data transfer. After 15 weeks, the final meeting was held with the company stakeholders to decide the launching of the integration. I gave the demo and ran them through the steps an end-user would be taking while using the integration. They liked it and discussed a bunch of marketing ideas for the integration right then and planned to launch it soon.</p>\n<p>Although, my internship wasn’t fully a product management one. It was more engineer-facing with less abstraction, which is a small part of the massive domain which a role like product management covers.</p>\n<blockquote>A product manager, however, covers all the activities involved in bringing the product out and acts as a bridge between the design team, development team, consulting and support team, sales and marketing team, and the finance team.</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/940/1*ucqLuKco8EuhvHF_BAlecw.jpeg\"></figure><p>A product manager is fundamentally responsible for giving the right inputs about the product - what makes the product solve a customer’s problem, and achieving the sweet spot of<strong> desirability, feasibility </strong>and<strong> viability</strong>.
